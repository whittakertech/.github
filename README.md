# WhittakerTech  
**Delivering Reliable Architecture**

WhittakerTech is a unified ecosystem of tools, engines, and practices designed by **Lee Whittaker** — a Fractional CTO and Rails Architect specializing in scalable systems, reliable deployments, and high-impact modernization for product teams.

Our mission is simple:

> **Clear architecture. Stable systems. Confident delivery.**

WhittakerTech serves as both a technical umbrella for multiple software engines and a public home for case studies, architectural patterns, and guidance for teams operating Ruby on Rails at scale.

## What We Do

### **Fractional CTO & Rails Architecture**
Supporting companies that need senior technical direction without hiring a full-time executive.

- Architecture assessments using 4+1 and system-mapping  
- Modernization strategies for long-lived Rails systems  
- Roadmaps, trade-off analysis, and scaling guidance  
- Developer experience improvements that increase velocity  

### **System Rescue & Performance Engineering**
Stabilizing critical products under real constraints.

- Debugging brittle async pipelines & background jobs  
- Eliminating concurrency defects and unsafe workflows  
- Performance tuning for throughput, memory, and latency  
- Docker-based deployment modernization and CI/CD hardening  

### **Modernization & Migration**
Preparing products for 2026 and beyond.

- Major Ruby and Rails version upgrades  
- Remediation of UTF-8 & internationalization failures  
- Safe alternatives to high-risk rewrites  
- Integration with third-party APIs and event-driven systems
