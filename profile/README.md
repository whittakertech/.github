# Hi, my name is Lee, and this is WhittakerTech

WhittakerTech is my home base for everything I build:  
Rails engines, design systems, internal tools, documentation generators, and the kind of architectural experiments that make complex apps feel calm and maintainable again.

I’ve spent over a decade doing full-stack engineering and rescuing fragile systems.  
Along the way, I developed a simple philosophy:

> **Good engineering is modular, documented, composable, and built for the long haul.**

WhittakerTech is the ecosystem where that philosophy lives.

## What I Do (as a Fractional CTO)

I help Rails teams and product companies who need **senior architecture**,  
**DevOps clarity**, and **system stabilization** — without hiring a full-time CTO.

If your app feels fragile, slow, unpredictable, or scary to touch…  
I help bring it back into a state where shipping features feel safe again.

Some of the things I specialize in:

- Architecture & 4+1 system modeling  
- High-throughput background jobs & async pipelines  
- Fixing concurrency bugs and data integrity issues  
- Performance work (memory, latency, N+1, indexing, profiling)  
- Modernizing legacy Rails apps  
- Docker migrations & CI/CD stabilization  
- Developer-experience (DX) improvements  
- System audits for founders & engineering leads  

My work tends to blend software engineering, architecture, developer mentoring, and “let’s figure out where the real bottleneck is.”

## The WhittakerTech Ecosystem

WhittakerTech is evolving into a constellation of reusable Rails engines and technical building blocks — each one designed to solve one problem well, and solve it forever.

### Core Engines

- **Aeon** — Scheduling and temporal orchestration  
- **Argus** — Global event watching and reporting  
- **Atlas** — Geolocation management  
- **Chronicle** — Rails-native CMS/blog engine  
- **Echo** — Universal remote API management  
- **Leeloo** — Permissions & RBAC layer  
- **Mercury** — Email/SMS/external communication handling  
- **Midas** — Currency normalization & financial consistency  
- **Nicodemus** — Auto-documentation, reflection, static docs  
- **Nimue** — Automatic form construction from API schema  
- **Mosaic** — Manual organization & hierarchy management  
- **Oscar** — Soft-delete & archival logic  
- **Sesame** — Authentication & secure identity  
- **Spectra** — Design system, tokens, and UI primitives  
- **Veritas** — Validation SSOT, client + server truth model  

These engines share a common DNA:

> **Modular. Documented. Composable. Long-term maintainable.**

They’re meant to be building blocks: strong foundations teams can reuse, extend, and trust.

## SaaS Offerings

Some of these engines power full SaaS applications:

- **Enseblize** — Scheduling & organization for choirs and ensembles  
- **Subscribify** — Universal subscription management  
- **Red Lily Music** — A music DSL + LilyPond-powered composition toolset  

They’re all in active development — each one built on the same architectural values that define the ecosystem.

## A Bit About Me

I’m a Fractional CTO, Rails architect, and performance engineer — but also a cross-stitcher, worldbuilder, analogist, and someone who genuinely loves the *craft* of engineering.

I think about systems the same way that I do about embroidery:  
tiny details, but part of a much bigger pattern.

With years of experience communicating with cross-disciplinary teams, I have made an art of distilling the most complicated of ideas into digestible analogies.  
Anything to make the idea *stick*.
